With a background in computer science, I bring a unique blend of technical expertise and design thinking to my work as a UI/UX designer. My understanding of development allows me to create user-centered, intuitive solutions that are not only visually appealing but also technically feasible. I’ve applied this skill set to design and build my own mobile app using Flutter, ensuring a seamless user experience from both a design and development perspective. Since starting my design journey in 2021, I’ve embraced challenges and consistently stayed ahead of trends to drive business growth and exceed user expectations.
Beyond design, I continue to explore mobile development with Flutter, enjoy reading, or unwind with endless runner games.
